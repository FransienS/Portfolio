## Bio
As a constant learner and collector of skills, this is home to my explorations and learnings of data science. Human behvaviour intrigues me and naturally led to a career in psychology, however after several years working in the field and wanting to understand health on a broader level, I pursued further studies in public health. During my academic training, which was research-based in both fields, I not only learned the theory of research methods but also the importance of a thorough understanding of qualitative and quantitative research methods and their relationship, and that they are not mutually exclusive in research but should rather be seen as complementary. Being inherently more inclined to a qualitative approach, I am continually consciously focusing on developing my quantitative skills, hence my foray into data science.

I aim to keep learning and improving my skills by contributing to projects and doing my own, to see how I can incorporate this in my current career and seeing how things develop over time.
